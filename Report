The purpose of this program is to implement a series of functions in conjunction with provided Python code in order to produce a functional election prediction software.
This is accomplished by approaching the different incomplete functions in a step-by-step manner, building upon each section in order to produce a functional final product.
Within these various functions, the most important variables utilized are the "dict" and "set" variables.
Both of these proved necessary on multiple occasions in order to specify the type of output that should be produced from each function.
However, even with these clarrifications the completion of this project proved difficult due to the complexity of certain outputs required.
Most notably, any failure to fully implement one function accurately would severely detract from the possibility of completing further functions.
That being said, the step-by-step approach also allowed for a logical and effective approach to each section of the project.
This served as a useful means of direction in terms of what areas to focus on.
